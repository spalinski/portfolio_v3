    <h4>Hello!</h4>
    <p>
      I am an <b>independent freelance designer</b>, with a focus on books and
      graphic novels, illustration, and graphic design. I graduated with honors
      from the Parsons School of Design in 2023 and Iâ€™m currently based in
      Brooklyn, New York.
    </p>

    <p>
      With experience ranging from an Art & Design internship at Penguin Random
      House to working alongside Corraini Edizioni selling their books at the
      New York Art Book Fair, I love the world of publishing and literature. My
      approach to design work is characterized by its <b
        >composition and color</b
      >. In the case of book covers, posters, and graphic novels especially, the
      relationships between type, image, and meaning create a beautiful dance of
      visual connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am actively <b> seeking freelance opportunities and commissions! </b>
      If you are looking for someone who will bring enthusiasm and drive to your
      team or project, please look no further! I take on tasks ranging from digitally
      coloring illustrations, photo retouching, creating assets and presentations
      to editing for trailers, designing posters, creating websites for start-ups,
      illustration, and designing book covers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>I also have expansive experience as a Studio Assistant! </b>
