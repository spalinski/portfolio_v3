    <h4>Hello!</h4>

    <p>
      I am an <b>independent freelance designer</b>, with a focus on books and
      graphic novels, illustration, and graphic design. I graduated with honors
      from the Parsons School of Design in 2023 and Iâ€™m currently based in
      Brooklyn, New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      With experience ranging from an Art & Design internship at Penguin Random
      House to working alongside Corraini Edizioni selling their books at the
      New York Art Book Fair, I love the world of publishing and literature. My
      approach to design work is characterized by its
      <b>composition and color</b>. In the case of book covers, posters, and
      graphic novels especially, the relationships between type, image, and
      meaning create a beautiful dance of visual connections.
      <p>
        I am actively <b>seeking freelance opportunities</b> and commissions!
