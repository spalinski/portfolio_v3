      <h4>Hello!</h4>
      <p>
        I am an <b>independent freelance designer</b>, with a focus on books and
        graphic novels, illustration, and graphic design. I graduated with
        honors from the Parsons School of Design in 2023 and Iâ€™m currently based
        in Brooklyn, New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        With experience ranging from an Art & Design internship at Penguin
        Random House to working alongside Corraini Edizioni selling their books
        at the New York Art Book Fair, I love the world of publishing and
        literature. My approach to design work is characterized by its <b
          >composition and color</b
        >. In the case of book covers, posters, and graphic novels especially,
        the relationships between type, image, and meaning create a beautiful
        dance of visual connections.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am actively <b> seeking freelance opportunities and commissions! </b>
        If you are looking for someone who will bring enthusiasm and drive to your
        team or project, please look no further! I take on tasks ranging from digitally
        coloring illustrations, photo retouching, creating assets and presentations
        to editing for trailers, designing posters, creating websites for start-ups,
        illustration, and designing book covers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>I also have expansive experience as a Studio Assistant! </b>
