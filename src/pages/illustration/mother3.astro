      The following is an ongoing project that seeks to create spot
      illustrations and a light reimagining/redesign of the enemy characters in
      Nintendoâ€™s <em>Mother 3 </em> - a game so far only released in Japan and part
      of the Earthbound franchise. Yet, despite its niche-ness it has a very dedicated
      fanbase which I have been quietly a part of since I was 11 years old. <em
        >Mother 3
      </em> is one of my favorite games of all time for too many reasons to list
      off, but one of the major qualities that I love is the creature designs of
      this game! The enemy characters are beautifully varied in theme and presentation
      and yet together create a wonderfully coherent collection of characters. This
      game has exerted a significant influence on my aesthetic preferences, and continues
      to do so by giving me an opportunity to explore and present how I would translate
      these game sprites into digital spot illustrations - akin to the way in which
      the Pokemon franchise features spot illustrations for every Pokemon design.
      I want to honor these character designs and give them new life.
      <!-- I love this
        game truly, and I believe these are creature designs that should see
        more love for all the work and dedication that had been put into them. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are my spot illustrations; by hovering over an image you can see the
      original sprite!
